<h3> The Majestic Bengal Tiger</h3>
    <p>The Bengal tiger, Panthera tigris tigris, is one of the most iconic and majestic animals in the world. Native to the Indian subcontinent, this apex predator is known for its striking orange coat, bold black stripes, and piercing amber eyes.</p>   

<h3>Habitat and Range</h3>
<p>Bengal tigers primarily inhabit dense forests, mangroves, grasslands, and even swamps. The Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is one of their most famous habitats, shared by India and Bangladesh.</p>

<h3>Physical Features</h3>
<p>Weighing up to 600 pounds and measuring up to 10 feet in length, the Bengal tiger is a symbol of strength and beauty. Their stripes, unique to each individual, help them blend into their surroundings while hunting.</p>

<h3>Diet and Hunting</h3>
<p>Carnivorous by nature, Bengal tigers prey on deer, wild boar, and sometimes even larger animals like water buffalo. Their powerful build and stealthy movements make them exceptional hunters.</p>
<h3>A Symbol of Power</h3>
<p>For centuries, the Bengal tiger has been revered in Indian culture, symbolizing power, courage, and resilience. Its survival is not just crucial for maintaining biodiversity but also for preserving a cultural and ecological legacy.

    The Bengal tiger is more than a predator; it’s a reminder of the beauty and fragility of nature, urging us to protect and coexist with wildlife.</p>
